      <p>The Services are provided to you via software (the “Software”) created and run by the B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted
        Entity GmbH (hereinafter referred to as “BTE”, “us”, “we” or “our”) as defined below. The software is published
        and you are free to check out the code under
        <a href="https://github.com/KILTprotocol/socialkyc.io" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">github.com/KILTprotocol/socialkyc.io</a>

      <h2>What is SocialKYC</h2>

      <p>SocialKYC allows you to create, manage and use social credentials. Social credentials are credentials for your
        social accounts (such as LinkedIn, Twitter, TikTok, Discord, GitHub, etc.), email addresses or phone numbers as
        they are being release over time.</p>

      <p>A credential of your social identity is issued when you proved control of the respective social account, email
        address or phone number. You can use these credentials to access third party services for example for logging
        into services that accept such credential.</p>

      <p>Therefore, you can</p>

      <ul>
        <li>verify your digital identity by proving control of your social account, email address or phone number</li>
        <li>receive a social credential for your control of this social account, address or number</li>
        <li>store the social credential locally on your device in your wallet</li>
        <li>save a proof for the validity of your credential on the KILT blockchain and</li>
        <li>use these credentials and the proof for their validity for pages that allow their usage e.g. to log into
          their services or to leave your contact data.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>SocialKYC forgets about the user and the credential as soon as the credential is issued. Personal data is not
        stored, siloed, or shared.</p>

      <p>The data generated in and for your digital identities is stored locally on your device. </p>

      <p>SocialKYC stores a hash of each credential on the KILT blockchain to enable third parties to check the validity
        of a credential whenever you decide to share or show it.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How does it work</h2>

      <p>First, you are asked to connect your wallet with SocialKYC which needs to be downloaded before starting. At
        launch, the Website supports only the Sporran Wallet, other wallets may follow over time. For those other
        wallets, the process might differ slightly.</p>

      <p>The wallet allows you to create digital identities for which SocialKYC attests verifiable credentials; this
        attestation is done automatically by the Software. You can choose between a set of credentials to be attested.
        In a first phase, we gradually activate to support attestations for email addresses, Twitter accounts and
        DotSama names (pinning a name onto your addresses/identities in the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystem); credentials
        for further digital identities are planned to be released over time.</p>

      <p>To start the attestation process you first need to agree to the terms of a specific attestation (e.g. costs and
        expiration date) by signing a request for attestation with your identity’s password.</p>

      <p>In the beginning all credentials will be valid for a year and free of charge. This might change later, and
        costs and expiration date will then be shown and signed before each attestation process begins.</p>

      <p>Next you receive a credential that is not yet verified. Depending on the type of credential you need to perform
        a challenge to prove ownership of the credential. These challenges will be as follows:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>For email, you have to enter your email address you want to have attested. Then, you will receive a
          verification link that you need to click to show that you control the account.
        </li>
        <li>For your Twitter account, you need to enter your Twitter handle. Subsequently, SocialKYC provides a
          message you need to post publicly on your Twitter account. SocialKYC will check for the posting and verify the
          credential after that.
        </li>
        <li>For the DotSama name, you can pick a name.
          <ul>
            <li>No challenge is required. However more trust is generated when the user generates additional credentials
              with that same wallet identity since these will also be shown on KILT Stakeboard and potentially other
              platforms.
            </li>
            <li>Also, even if we do not hinder you from using any name of your choosing, please be aware that you are
              limited in your name usage by other individuals or entities who are in rightful possession of names,
              trademarks etc. already and have them protected according to their local or other jurisdictions.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Once a credential is verified an attestation hash is anchored to the KILT blockchain.</p>

      <h2>Your Commitments</h2>

      <p>By using this service for one or more of your social channels, you confirm that both this channel and this
        address via which you apply for the credential actually only belong to you, i.e. that your identity is linked to
        both and that no other identity is linked to them.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, you confirm that the use of the service and the further disposal of the credential does not
        violate the rights of third parties.</p>

      <p>If you have received a credential for a social account but have actually lost or relinquished access to the
        respective social account or suspect its fraudulent use, you will immediately terminate the use of the
        credential in order to avoid giving the wrong impression to the public or third parties. We accept no liability
        in this respect. Consequently, the credential is generated only once after your use of the Software, provided
        that the respective prerequisite is fulfilled.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Liability</h2>

      <p>BTE is liable for damages that are based on an intentional or grossly negligent breach of duty by BTE, its
        legal representatives or various agents.</p>

      <p>In the event of a breach of essential contractual duties, BTE shall only be liable for the contractually
        typical, foreseeable damage if this was simply cause by negligence. Significant contractual obligations are
        those whose fulfilment enables the proper execution of the contract in the first place and whose compliance you
        can regularly
        rely on.</p>

      <p>The limitation of the two preceding paragraphs also apply to the legal representatives and various agents of
        BTE, if claims are asserted directly against them. The liability limitations resulting from the two preceding
        paragraphs do not apply insofar as BTE fraudulently concealed the defect or assumed a guarantee for the quality
        of SocialKYC. </p>

      <p>Liability for culpable injury to life, limb and health and liability under Product Liability Act remain
        unaffected.</p>

      <p>Any additional claims for damages are excluded.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Risk information</h2>

      <p>The following risk information contains a list of risks associated with the use of SocialKYC. The list is not
        exhaustive. It is not excluded that further unknown or unpredictable risks exist.</p>

      <p>Independent of the creation of credentials but also to prevent others from getting credentials for controlling
        your account, please always keep the password and other access data to your social accounts, email addresses and
        phones safe.</p>

      <p>SocialKYC is used via the Website and its services are accessed via your wallet – please check all the
        information, instruction and warnings given about your wallet by its provider and closely follow the advice
        given. Always ensure that you do not lose your access data to your wallet and keep access to your wallet as well
        as the values and credentials stored in it safe from access by others.</p>

      <p>SocialKYC communicates with the KILT Blockchain and depends on its functionality in regard to the proof of
        validity of your credentials. Errors, dysfunctionalities, including failure of KILT Blockchain or the technical
        ecosystem in which it lives may adversely affect the SocialKYC functionalities.</p>

      <p>You acknowledge and agree that we have no support, service level, or other obligations like these
        hereunder.</p>

      <p>SocialKYC and in particular the underlying software application may be the subject of hacking or other
        malicious interference by unauthorised third parties resulting in the loss, theft or other violation of
        data.</p>

      <p>Because the software of SocialKYC is published, there is a risk that a third party may copy it and
        unconsciously or knowingly incorporate errors leading to potential adverse consequences for the usability and
        functionality of the SocialKYC. To ensure you are using the original, always use through us directly and if
        uncertain, compare the code with the code published on GitHub before usage and only use if it matches fully with
        the code there.</p>

      <p>Communication via internet-based systems is fundamentally susceptible to data/information being read out and
        possibly even changed. We have no influence on which processes (now and in the future) run in the background of
        the web browser or the wallet used.</p>
