  <h1>Terms and Conditions for SocialKYC</h1>

  <h2>Application of These Terms and Conditions</h2>
  <p>For all services provided by the SocialKYC Software under the website <a
      href="https://socialkyc.io">socialkyc.io</a> (the “Website”), these Terms and Conditions shall apply.</p>

  <p>The Services are provided to you via software (the “Software”) created and run by KILT Foundation (hereinafter
    referred to as “KILT Foundation”, “us”, “we” or “our”). The software is published and you are free to check out the
    code on <a href="https://github.com/BTE-Trusted-Entity/socialkyc.io">GitHub</a>.</p>

  <h2>What SocialKYC is</h2>
  <p>SocialKYC allows you to create, manage, and use social credentials. These credentials verify your control over
    social accounts (Twitter, Discord, GitHub, Twitch, etc.), email addresses, or phone numbers.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Verify your digital identity</li>
    <li>Receive a social credential</li>
    <li>Store credentials in your wallet</li>
    <li>Save proof of validity on the KILT blockchain</li>
    <li>Use credentials to log into services</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How SocialKYC Works</h2>
  <p>Users must connect their wallet with SocialKYC before starting. Currently, only the Sporran wallet is supported.
    The verification process includes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Email verification via confirmation link</li>
    <li>Twitter verification via public post</li>
    <li>Discord, GitHub, Twitch, Telegram, and YouTube verification via login and permission grants</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Once verified, a credential is issued, and an attestation hash is anchored to the KILT blockchain.</p>

  <h2>Your Commitments</h2>
  <p>By using SocialKYC, you confirm that your identity is correctly linked to your social accounts. If you lose control
    of an account, you must stop using the credential immediately.</p>

  <h2>Liability</h2>
  <p>KILT Foundation is only liable for intentional or gross negligence. Claims for damages are otherwise excluded.</p>

  <h2>Risk Information</h2>
  <p>Users must protect their credentials and access data. SocialKYC depends on the KILT blockchain, which may
    experience errors affecting its functionalities.</p>

  <h2>Right to Change Terms</h2>
  <p>KILT Foundation reserves the right to modify SocialKYC’s terms, credentials, and services at any time.</p>

  <h2>License</h2>
  <p>Copyright © 2025, KILT Foundation. All rights reserved.</p>

  <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
  <p>These Terms and Conditions are governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands. Any disputes shall be resolved in the
    jurisdiction of KILT Foundation’s registered office.</p>
