            ACCESSING OR USING THE APPLICABLE SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY

          <p>
            YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE 18 YEARS OLD OR OLDER AND

            CONDITIONS.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>What SocialKYC is</h2>

          <p>
            SocialKYC allows you to create, manage and use social credentials.
            Social credentials are credentials for your social accounts (such as
            Twitter, Discord, GitHub, Twitch, etc.), email addresses or
            phone numbers as they become available over time in SocialKYC.
          </p>

          <p>
            A credential of your social identity is issued after you have proved
            control of the respective social account, email address or phone
            number. You can use these credentials to access third party services
            for example for logging into services that accept such credential.
          </p>

          <p>Therefore, you can:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Verify your digital identity by proving control of your social
              account, email address or phone number
            </li>
            <li>
              Receive a social credential for your control of this social
              account, address or number
            </li>
            <li>
              Store the social credential locally on your device in your wallet
            </li>
            <li>
              Save a proof for the validity of your credential on the KILT
              blockchain and
            </li>
            <li>
              Use these credentials and the proof for their validity for pages
              that allow their usage e.g. to log into their services or to leave
              your contact data.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            SocialKYC forgets about the user and the credential as soon as the
            credential is issued. Personal data is not stored, siloed, or
            shared.
          </p>

          <p>
            The data generated in and for your digital identities is stored
            locally on your device.
          </p>

          <p>
            SocialKYC stores a hash of each credential on the KILT blockchain to
            enable third parties to check the validity of a credential whenever
            you decide to share or show it.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>How SocialKYC Works</h2>

          <p>
            First, you are asked to connect your wallet with SocialKYC, which
            needs to be downloaded before starting. At launch, the Website
            supports only the Sporran wallet developed by BOTLabs; other
            wallets may follow over time. For those other wallets, the process
            might differ slightly.
          </p>

          <p>
            The wallet allows you to create digital identities for which
            SocialKYC attests verifiable credentials; this attestation is done
            automatically by the Software. You can choose between a set of
            credentials to be attested. Currently, we are supporting
            attestations for email addresses as well as Twitter, Discord,
            GitHub, Twitch, Telegram and YouTube accounts; credentials for
            further digital identities are planned to be released over time.
          </p>

          <p>
            To start the attestation process you first need to agree to the
            terms of a specific attestation (e.g. costs and expiration date) by
            signing a request for attestation with your identity’s password.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the beginning all credentials will be valid for a year and free
            of charge. This might change later, and costs and expiration date
            will then be shown and signed before each attestation process
            begins.
          </p>

          <p>
            Next you receive a credential that is not yet verified. Depending on
            the type of credential you need to perform a challenge to prove
            ownership of the credential. These challenges will be as follows:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              For your email address, you have to enter the email address you
              want to have attested. SocailKYC will send you an email with a confirmation link.
              After confirming your email address, you can  sign the data with one of your accounts in Sporran,
              and SocialKYC will create the credential.
            </li>
            <li>
              For your Twitter account, you need to enter your Twitter handle.
              Subsequently, SocialKYC provides a message you need to post
              publicly on your Twitter account. Sporran opens for you to choose
              an account to issue the credential to and sign.
              SocialKYC will check for the posting, and if successfull, issue the credential
              to that account.
            </li>
            <li>
              For your Discord account, you click onto the button to sign into
              Discord and in a new tab you sign in to the account you want to
              have attested. Then, you grant us a one-time permission to fetch
              your Discord user ID as well as username and discriminator. We
              show you the fetched data and after you clicked to confirm this
              data, SocialKYC creates the credential with this data and anchors
              it to the blockchain.
            </li>
            <li>
              For your GitHub account, you click onto the button to sign into
              GitHub and in a new tab you sign in to the account you want to
              have attested. Then, you grant us a permission to fetch your
              GitHub user ID as well as your username. We show you the fetched
              data and after you clicked to confirm this data, SocialKYC creates
              the credential with this data and anchors it to the blockchain.
            </li>
            <li>
              For your Twitch account, you click onto the button to sign into
              Twitch and in a new tab you log in to the account you want to have
              attested. Then, you grant us a one-time permission to fetch your
              Twitch user ID and username. We show you the fetched data and
              after you clicked to confirm this data, SocialKYC creates the
              credential with this data and anchors it to the blockchain.
            </li>
            <li>
              For your Telegram account, you click onto the button to sign into
              Telegram and in a new tab you log in to the account you want to
              have attested. Then, you grant us a one-time permission to fetch
              your Telegram user ID and first name, optionally the username and
              last name if available. We show you the fetched data and after you
              click to confirm this data, SocialKYC creates the credential with
              this data and anchors it to the blockchain.
            </li>
            <li>
              For your YouTube account, you click onto the button to sign into
              YouTube and in a new tab you log in to the Google account that
              owns/manages the YouTube channel you want to have attested. If
              there are multiple channels owned/managed by this account, on a
              second login screen you will select the specific channel you want
              to have attested. Then, you grant us a one-time permission to
              fetch your YouTube channel ID and channel name. We show you the
              fetched data and after you clicked to confirm this data, SocialKYC
              creates the credential with this data and anchors it to the
              blockchain.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Once a credential is verified an attestation hash is anchored to the
            KILT blockchain.

          <h2>Your Commitments</h2>

          <p>
            By using this service for one or more of your social channels, you
            confirm that both this channel and this address via which you apply
            for the credential actually only belong to you, i.e. that your
            identity is linked to both and that no other identity is linked to
            them or in case of a credential for a YoutTube brand channel that
            you are the owner of that Youtube brand channel or have been
            delegated access to that YouTube brand channel and act in accordance
            with the owner(s) of that channel.
          </p>

          <p>
            Furthermore, you confirm that the use of the service and the further
            disposal of the credential does not violate the rights of third
            parties.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you have received a credential for a social account but have
            actually lost or relinquished access to the respective social
            account or suspect its fraudulent use, you will immediately
            terminate the use of the credential in order to avoid giving the
            wrong impression to the public or third parties. We accept no
            liability in this respect. Consequently, the credential is generated
            only once after your use of the Software, provided that the
            respective prerequisite is fulfilled.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Liability</h2>

          <p>
            BOTLabs is liable for damages that are based on an intentional or
            grossly negligent breach of duty by BOTLabs, its legal representatives
            or various agents.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the event of a breach of essential contractual duties, BOTLabs shall
            only be liable for the contractually typical, foreseeable damage if
            this was simply cause by negligence. Significant contractual
            obligations are those whose fulfilment enables the proper execution
            of the contract in the first place and whose compliance you can
            regularly rely on.
          </p>

          <p>
            The limitation of the two preceding paragraphs also apply to the
            legal representatives and various agents of BOTLabs, if claims are
            asserted directly against them. The liability limitations resulting
            from the two preceding paragraphs do not apply insofar as BOTLabs
            fraudulently concealed the defect or assumed a guarantee for the
            quality of SocialKYC.
          </p>

          <p>
            Liability for culpable injury to life, limb and health and liability
            under Product Liability Act remain unaffected.
          </p>

          <p>Any additional claims for damages are excluded.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>Risk information</h2>

          <p>
            The following risk information contains a list of risks associated
            with the use of SocialKYC. The list is not exhaustive. It is not
            excluded that further unknown or unpredictable risks exist.
          </p>

          <p>
            Independent of the creation of credentials but also to prevent
            others from getting credentials for controlling your account, please
            always keep the password and other access data to your social
            accounts, email addresses and phones safe.
          </p>

          <p>
            SocialKYC is used via the Website and its services are accessed via
            your wallet – please check all the information, instruction and
            warnings given about your wallet by its provider and closely follow
            the advice given. Always ensure that you do not lose your access
            data to your wallet and keep access to your wallet as well as the
            values and credentials stored in it safe from access by others.
          </p>

          <p>
            SocialKYC communicates with the KILT blockchain and depends on its
            functionality in regard to the proof of validity of your
            credentials. Errors, dysfunctionalities, including failure of the
            KILT blockchain or the technical ecosystem in which it lives may
            adversely affect the SocialKYC functionalities.
          </p>

          <p>
            You acknowledge and agree that we have no support, service level, or
            other obligations like these hereunder.
          </p>

          <p>
            SocialKYC and in particular the underlying software application may
            be the subject of hacking or other malicious interference by
            unauthorized third parties resulting in the loss, theft or other
            violation of data.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because the software of SocialKYC is published, there is a risk that
            a third party may copy it and unconsciously or knowingly incorporate
            errors leading to potential adverse consequences for the usability
            and functionality of the Software. To ensure you are using the
            original, always use through us directly and if uncertain, compare
            the code with the code published on GitHub before usage and only use
            if it matches fully with the code there.
          </p>

          <p>
            Communication via internet-based systems is fundamentally
            susceptible to data/information being read out and possibly even
            changed. We have no influence on which processes (now and in the
            future) run in the background of the web browser or the wallet used.
