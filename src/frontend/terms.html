    <h1>Terms of Use for SocialKYC</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Application of These Terms of Use</h2>

      <p>For all services provided by the SocialKYC Software under the website

        Entity GmbH (hereinafter referred to as “BTE”, “us”, “we” or “our”) as defined below. The software is published
        and you are free to check out the code under
        <a href="https://github.com/KILTprotocol/socialkyc.io" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">github.com/KILTprotocol/socialkyc.io</a>.

      <h2>What is SocialKYC</h2>

      <p>SocialKYC allows you to create, manage and use social credentials. Social credentials are credentials for your
        social accounts (such as Twitter, TikTok, Discord, GitHub, Twitch, etc.), email addresses or phone numbers as
        they become available over time in SocialKYC.</p>

      <p>A credential of your social identity is issued after you have proved control of the respective social account,
        email
        address or phone number. You can use these credentials to access third party services for example for logging
        into services that accept such credential.</p>

      <p>Therefore, you can:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Verify your digital identity by proving control of your social account, email address or phone number</li>
        <li>Receive a social credential for your control of this social account, address or number</li>
        <li>Store the social credential locally on your device in your wallet</li>
        <li>Save a proof for the validity of your credential on the KILT blockchain and</li>
        <li>Use these credentials and the proof for their validity for pages that allow their usage e.g. to log into
          their services or to leave your contact data.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>SocialKYC forgets about the user and the credential as soon as the credential is issued. Personal data is not
        stored, siloed, or shared.</p>

      <p>The data generated in and for your digital identities is stored locally on your device. </p>

      <p>SocialKYC stores a hash of each credential on the KILT blockchain to enable third parties to check the validity
        of a credential whenever you decide to share or show it.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How SocialKYC Works</h2>

      <p>First, you are asked to connect your wallet with SocialKYC, which needs to be downloaded before starting. At
        launch, the Website supports only the Sporran wallet also developed by BTE; other wallets may follow over time.
        For those other
        wallets, the process might differ slightly.</p>

      <p>The wallet allows you to create digital identities for which SocialKYC attests verifiable credentials; this
        attestation is done automatically by the Software. You can choose between a set of credentials to be attested.
        Currently, we are supporting attestations for email addresses as well as Twitter, Discord, GitHub, Twitch, Telegram, YouTube and Instagram
        accounts; credentials for further digital identities are planned to be released over time.</p>

      <p>To start the attestation process you first need to agree to the terms of a specific attestation (e.g. costs and
        expiration date) by signing a request for attestation with your identity’s password.</p>

      <p>In the beginning all credentials will be valid for a year and free of charge. This might change later, and
        costs and expiration date will then be shown and signed before each attestation process begins.</p>

      <p>Next you receive a credential that is not yet verified. Depending on the type of credential you need to perform
        a challenge to prove ownership of the credential. These challenges will be as follows:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>For your email address, you have to enter the email address you want to have attested. Then, you will receive a
          verification link that you need to click to show that you control the account.
        </li>
        <li>For your Twitter account, you need to enter your Twitter handle. Subsequently, SocialKYC provides a
          message you need to post publicly on your Twitter account. SocialKYC will check for the posting and verify the
          credential after that.
        </li>
        <li>For your Discord account, you click onto the button to sign into Discord and in a new tab you sign in to the account
          you want to have attested. Then, you grant us a one-time permission to fetch your Discord user ID as well as username
          and discriminator. We show you the fetched data and after you clicked to confirm this data, SocialKYC creates the 
          credential with this data and anchors it to the blockchain.
        </li>
        <li>For your GitHub account, you click onto the button to sign into GitHub and in a new tab you sign in to the account
          you want to have attested. Then, you grant us a permission to fetch your GitHub user ID as well as your username. 
          We show you the fetched data and after you clicked to confirm this data, SocialKYC creates the credential with this 
          data and anchors it to the blockchain.
        </li>
        <li>For your Twitch account, you click onto the button to sign into Twitch and in a new tab you log in to the account
          you want to have attested. Then, you grant us a one-time permission to fetch your Twitch user ID and username. We 
          show you the fetched data and after you clicked to confirm this data, SocialKYC creates the credential with this 
          data and anchors it to the blockchain.
        </li>
        <li>For your Telegram account, you click onto the button to sign into Telegram and in a new tab you log in to the 
          account you want to have attested. Then, you grant us a one-time permission to fetch your Telegram user ID and 
          first name, optionally the username and last name if available. We show you the fetched data and after you 
          click to confirm this data, SocialKYC creates the credential with this data and anchors it to the blockchain.
        </li>
         <li>For your YouTube account, you click onto the button to sign into YouTube and in a new tab you log in to the 
           Google account that owns/manages the YouTube channel you want to have attested. If there are multiple channels 
           owned/managed by this account, on a second login screen you will select the specific channel you want to have 
           attested. Then, you grant us a one-time permission to fetch your YouTube channel ID and channel name. We show 
           you the fetched data and after you clicked to confirm this data, SocialKYC creates the credential with this 
           data and anchors it to the blockchain.
        </li>
        <li>For your Instagram account, you click onto the button to sign into Instagram and in a new tab you sign in 
          to the account you want to have attested. Then, you grant SocialKYC permission to fetch your Instagram user 
          ID as well as username and the account type. We show you the fetched data and after you clicked to confirm 
          this data, SocialKYC creates the credential with this data and anchors it to the blockchain.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Once a credential is verified an attestation hash is anchored to the KILT blockchain.</p>

      <h2>Your Commitments</h2>

      <p>By using this service for one or more of your social channels, you confirm that both this channel and this
        address via which you apply for the credential actually only belong to you, i.e. that your identity is linked to
        both and that no other identity is linked to them or in case of a credential for a YoutTube brand channel that you are the owner of that Youtube 
        brand channel or have been delegated access to that YouTube brand channel and act in accordance with the owner(s) of that channel.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, you confirm that the use of the service and the further disposal of the credential does not
        violate the rights of third parties.</p>

      <p>If you have received a credential for a social account but have actually lost or relinquished access to the
        respective social account or suspect its fraudulent use, you will immediately terminate the use of the
        credential in order to avoid giving the wrong impression to the public or third parties. We accept no liability
        in this respect. Consequently, the credential is generated only once after your use of the Software, provided
        that the respective prerequisite is fulfilled.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Liability</h2>

      <p>BTE is liable for damages that are based on an intentional or grossly negligent breach of duty by BTE, its
        legal representatives or various agents.</p>

      <p>In the event of a breach of essential contractual duties, BTE shall only be liable for the contractually
        typical, foreseeable damage if this was simply cause by negligence. Significant contractual obligations are
        those whose fulfilment enables the proper execution of the contract in the first place and whose compliance you
        can regularly
        rely on.</p>

      <p>The limitation of the two preceding paragraphs also apply to the legal representatives and various agents of
        BTE, if claims are asserted directly against them. The liability limitations resulting from the two preceding
        paragraphs do not apply insofar as BTE fraudulently concealed the defect or assumed a guarantee for the quality
        of SocialKYC. </p>

      <p>Liability for culpable injury to life, limb and health and liability under Product Liability Act remain
        unaffected.</p>

      <p>Any additional claims for damages are excluded.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Risk information</h2>

      <p>The following risk information contains a list of risks associated with the use of SocialKYC. The list is not
        exhaustive. It is not excluded that further unknown or unpredictable risks exist.</p>

      <p>Independent of the creation of credentials but also to prevent others from getting credentials for controlling
        your account, please always keep the password and other access data to your social accounts, email addresses and
        phones safe.</p>

      <p>SocialKYC is used via the Website and its services are accessed via your wallet – please check all the
        information, instruction and warnings given about your wallet by its provider and closely follow the advice
        given. Always ensure that you do not lose your access data to your wallet and keep access to your wallet as well
        as the values and credentials stored in it safe from access by others.</p>

      <p>SocialKYC communicates with the KILT blockchain and depends on its functionality in regard to the proof of
        validity of your credentials. Errors, dysfunctionalities, including failure of the KILT blockchain or the technical
        ecosystem in which it lives may adversely affect the SocialKYC functionalities.</p>

      <p>You acknowledge and agree that we have no support, service level, or other obligations like these
        hereunder.</p>

      <p>SocialKYC and in particular the underlying software application may be the subject of hacking or other
        malicious interference by unauthorized third parties resulting in the loss, theft or other violation of
        data.</p>

      <p>Because the software of SocialKYC is published, there is a risk that a third party may copy it and
        unconsciously or knowingly incorporate errors leading to potential adverse consequences for the usability and
        functionality of the SocialKYC. To ensure you are using the original, always use through us directly and if
        uncertain, compare the code with the code published on GitHub before usage and only use if it matches fully with
        the code there.</p>

      <p>Communication via internet-based systems is fundamentally susceptible to data/information being read out and
        possibly even changed. We have no influence on which processes (now and in the future) run in the background of
        the web browser or the wallet used.</p>
