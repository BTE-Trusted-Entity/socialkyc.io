          <h2>Part I – General Privacy Policy</h2>

          <p>
            We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our
            enterprise. Data protection is of a particularly high priority for
            the management of B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH. The use
            of the internet pages of B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH is
            possible without any indication of personal data; however, if a
            data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our
            website, processing of personal data could become necessary. If
            the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no
            statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent
            from the data subject.
          </p>
          <p>
            The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, email
            address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in
            line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in
            accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations
            applicable to B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH. By means of
            this data protection declaration, our enterprise would like to
            inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the
            personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data
            subjects are informed, by means of this data protection
            declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the controller, B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH has
            implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to
            ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed
            through this website. However, internet-based data transmissions
            may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may
            not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to
            transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g., by
            telephone.
          </p>

            <h3>1. Definitions</h3>

            <p>
              The data protection declaration of B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted
              Entity GmbH is based on the terms used by the European legislator
              for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
              Our data protection declaration should be legible and
              understandable for the general public, as well as our customers
              and business partners. To ensure this, we would like to first
              explain the terminology used.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the
              following terms:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <h4>a) Personal data</h4>

                <p>
                  Personal data means any information relating to an identified
                  or identifiable natural person (“data subject”). An
                  identifiable natural person is one who can be identified,
                  directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an
                  identifier such as a name, an identification number, location
                  data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific
                  to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic,
                  cultural or social identity of that natural person.
                </p>

              <li>
                <h4>b) Data subject</h4>

                <p>
                  Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person,
                  whose personal data is processed by the controller responsible
                  for the processing.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h4>c) Processing</h4>

                  Processing is any operation or set of operations which is
                  performed on personal data or on sets of personal data,
                  whether or not by automated means, such as collection,
                  recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or
                  alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by
                  transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available,
                  alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h4>d) Restriction of processing</h4>

                <p>
                  Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal
                  data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h4>e) Profiling</h4>

                <p>
                  Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal
                  data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate
                  certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in
                  particular to analyze or predict aspects concerning that
                  natural person’s performance at work, economic situation,
                  health, personal preferences, interests, reliability,
                  behavior, location or movements.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h4>f) Pseudonymization</h4>

                <p>
                  Pseudonymization is the processing of personal data in such a
                  manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a
                  specific data subject without the use of additional
                  information, provided that such additional information is kept
                  separately and is subject to technical and organizational
                  measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed
                  to an identified or identifiable natural person.
                </p>

              <li>
                <h4>
                  g) Controller or controller responsible for the processing
                </h4>

                <p>
                  Controller or controller responsible for the processing is the
                  natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other
                  body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the
                  purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where
                  the purposes and means of such processing are determined by
                  Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific
                  criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or
                  Member State law.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h4>h) Processor</h4>

                <p>
                  Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority,
                  agency, or other body which processes personal data on behalf
                  of the controller.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h4>i) Recipient</h4>

                <p>

                  authorities which may receive personal data in the framework
                  of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member
                  State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing
                  of those data by those public authorities shall be in
                  compliance with the applicable data protection rules according
                  to the purposes of the processing.

            <h3>3. Provision of the Website and creation of log files</h3>

            <p>
              Every time you visit our website, the system of our commissioned
              provider (hosting services): Amazon Web Services, Inc, based in
              410 Terry Avenue North Seattle WA 98109, United States, collects
              and stores data and information from the computer system of the
              calling computer. For that purpose, only servers in Frankfurt am
              Main, Germany are used.
            </p>
            <p>
              We automatically collect and store information in so-called server
              log files, which the computer system of the computer used to use
              the Website automatically transmits to us: (i) browser type and
              browser version; (ii) operating system used; (iii) your IP
              address; (iv) time of the server inquiry; (v) website from which
              you accessed our website.
            </p>
            <p>
              The data are stored in the log files of our system. These data are
              not stored together with other User’s personal data and are not
              combined with other data sources.
            </p>
            <p>
              The legal basis for the temporary storage of data and log files is
              Art. 6 paragraph 1 lit. f) GDPR. The temporary storage by the
              system is necessary to enable the Website to be delivered to your
              computer. The storage in log files is done to ensure the
              functionality of the Website. In addition, the data are used to
              optimize the Website and to ensure the security of our information
              technology systems. For these purposes, the data must be stored
              for the duration of the session.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our legitimate interest in data processing pursuant to Article 6
              paragraph 1 lit. f) GDPR also lies in these purposes. Without
              collection and storage of data as described, the operation of the
              Website is not possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              The data are stored for not more than 24 hours and will be then
              deleted from the web server.

                  Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European
                  legislator to obtain from the controller the erasure of
                  personal data concerning him or her without undue delay, and
                  the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal
                  data without undue delay where one of the following grounds
                  applies, as long as the processing is not necessary:

                  <li>
                    The data subject withdraws consent to which the processing
                    is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR,
                    or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there is

                    The data subject objects to the processing pursuant to
                    Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there are no overriding
                    legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject
                    objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of the
                    GDPR.

                <p>
                  If one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data
                  subject wishes to request the erasure of personal data stored
                  by B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH, he or she may, at
                  any time, contact any employee of the controller. An employee
                  of B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH shall promptly ensure
                  that the erasure request is complied with immediately.

                  Where the controller has made personal data public and is
                  obliged pursuant to Article 17(1) to erase the personal data,
                  the controller, taking account of available technology and the
                  cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including
                  technical measures, to inform other controllers processing the
                  personal data that the data subject has requested erasure by
                  such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of,
                  those personal data, as far as processing is not required. An
                  employee of B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH will

                <h4>e) Right of restriction of processing</h4>

                <p>
                  Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European
                  legislator to obtain from the controller restriction of
                  processing where one of the following applies:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data
                    subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the
                    accuracy of the personal data.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The processing is unlawful, and the data subject opposes the
                    erasure of the personal data and requests instead the
                    restriction of their use instead.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The controller no longer needs the personal data for the
                    purposes of the processing, but they are required by the
                    data subject for the establishment, exercise or defense of
                    legal claims.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to
                    Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether
                    the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of
                    the data subject.

                  subject wishes to request the restriction of the processing of
                  personal data stored by B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity
                  GmbH, he or she may at any time contact any employee of the
                  controller. The employee of B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity
                  GmbH will arrange the restriction of the processing.

                <h4>f) Right to data portability</h4>

                <p>
                  Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European
                  legislator, to receive the personal data concerning him or
                  her, which was provided to a controller, in a structured,
                  commonly used, and machine-readable format. He or she shall
                  have the right to transmit those data to another controller
                  without hindrance from the controller to which the personal
                  data have been provided, as long as the processing is based on
                  consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR or
                  point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, or on a contract
                  pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, and the
                  processing is carried out by automated means, as long as the
                  processing is not necessary for the performance of a task
                  carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
                  official authority vested in the controller.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Furthermore, in exercising his or her right to data
                  portability pursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR, the data
                  subject shall have the right to have personal data transmitted
                  directly from one controller to another, where technically
                  feasible and when doing so does not adversely affect the
                  rights and freedoms of others.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In order to assert the right to data portability, the data

                  particular situation, at any time, to processing of personal
                  data concerning him or her, which is based on point (e) or (f)
                  of Article 6(1) of the GDPR. This also applies to profiling

                <p>
                  B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH shall no longer process

                  demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing
                  which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data
                  subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of

            <h3>7. Legal basis for the processing</h3>

            <p>
              Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing
              operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing
              purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the
              performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as
              is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary
              for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the
              processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies
              to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out
              pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries
              concerning our products or services. Is our company subject to a
              legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required,
              such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is
              based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of
              personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of
              the data subject or of another natural person. This would be the
              case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and
              his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information
              would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third
              party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d
              GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on Article
              6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing
              operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned
              legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the
              legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party,
              except where such interests are overridden by the interests or
              fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require
              protection of personal data. Such processing operations are
              particularly permissible because they have been specifically
              mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a
              legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a
              client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).

            <p>
              Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1)
              lit. f GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business
              in favor of the well-being of all our employees and the
              shareholders.

            <h3>9. Period for which the personal data will be stored</h3>

            <p>
              The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal
              data is the respective statutory retention period. After
              expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely
              deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfilment
              of the contract or the initiation of a contract.

              requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract;
              Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data;
              possible consequences of failure to provide such data
            </h3>

            <p>
              We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required
              by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual
              provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner).
              Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data
              subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be
              processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to
              provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract
              with him or her. The non-provision of the personal data would have
              the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not
              be concluded. Before personal data is provided by the data
              subject, the data subject must contact any employee. The employee
              clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the
              personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for
              the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to
              provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of
              the personal data.

          <h2>Part II – Usage of personal information in SocialKYC</h2>

          <p>
            This part explicitly lists the data collected in the performance of
            each service and how it is stored, used and deleted.
          </p>

          <p><u>When issuing a credential for email address:</u></p>

          <ul>
            <li>Our server receives the email address from the user.</li>
            <li>
              The server prepares a Request for attestation object for the user
              to sign and sends it to the user. This object contains the email
              but is not stored anywhere.
            </li>
            <li>
              Our server receives the signed Request for attestation object from
              the user and temporarily stores it until the user confirmation,
              but no longer than 1 hour after the last user activity. The object
              contains the email address and the DID. The server sends a message
              to this email address via the Amazon SES datacenter in EU, which
              is not configured to store any logs about addresses used. The
              message contains a link with a confirmation code: a random number
              that references the user data but does not contain it.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the user opens the message and clicks the confirmation link
              within it, then our server receives this confirmation code. The
              server signs the stored Request for attestation object. Only the
              signature is then stored on the public KILT blockchain, but the
              signature itself does not contain any of the personal information,
              and this information is not recoverable from the signature. After
              that all the information stored about this user is immediately
              deleted from the server.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the user does not click the confirmation link within one hour
              after it was sent out, all their stored data and the confirmation
              code are automatically deleted.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p><u>When issuing a credential for Twitter username:</u></p>

          <ul>
            <li>Our server receives the username from the user.</li>
            <li>
              The server prepares a Request for attestation object for the user
              to sign and sends it to the user. This object contains the
              username but is not stored anywhere.
            </li>
            <li>
              Our server receives the signed Request for attestation object from
              the user and temporarily stores it until the user confirmation,
              but no longer than 1 hour after the last user activity. The object
              contains the username and the DID. SocialKYC asks the user to
              Tweet a predefined text. The text contains a confirmation code: a
              random number that references the user data but does not contain
              it. The server stores the username and starts periodically
              checking public tweets of this username looking for the
              confirmation code.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the user is inactive for one hour, all their stored data, the
              username, and the confirmation code are deleted.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the user tweets the predefined text containing the confirmation
              code, then our server detects this and stops checking the tweets
              of this username. The server signs the stored Request for
              attestation object. Only the signature is then stored on the
              public KILT blockchain, but the signature itself does not contain
              any of the personal information, and this information is not
              recoverable from the signature. After that all the information
              stored about this user is immediately deleted from the server.
